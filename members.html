            <h3>Director of Workforce and Development</h3>
            A Leader in Peer-Centered Mental Health and Reentry Services, Jason
            Garcia currently serves as the Director of Workforce and Development
            for Project Return Peer Support Network (PRPSN), where he brings a
            wealth of lived experience, education, training, and professional
            expertise to the forefront of mental health and reentry services.
            His mission is to ensure that individuals who have been marginalized
            and left without support receive the peer-centered services they
            need to rebuild their lives. A passionate advocate for systemic
            change, Jason works tirelessly to train and empower peers to take on
            meaningful roles within service provision. He is dedicated to
            reshaping how mental health and reentry services are delivered,
            striving to create an inclusive and compassionate system that
            recognizes the value of lived experience.
          </p>

          <p>
            Jason‚Äôs academic background includes a Bachelor of Arts degree from
            San Jose State University, an Associate of Arts in General Education
            from Hartnell Community College, and a Mental Health Rehabilitation
            Specialist Certificate through the Jump Start Fellowship, a program
            of Mental Health America of Los Angeles. His journey with PRPSN
            began in 2015, where he found an organization that valued his lived
            experience rather than seeing it as something to be hidden or
            dismissed. Prior to joining PRPSN, Jason served as a Job Placement
            Coordinator at the Independent Living Center of Southern California
            (ILCSC), assisting individuals with disabilities in securing and
            maintaining employment. Before that, he worked as a Case Manager at
            ILCSC, helping individuals achieve their goals related to housing,
            benefits, transportation, and independent living. One of Jason‚Äôs
            most fulfilling professional roles was his five-plus years with the
            Amity Foundation, where he served as a Peer Mentor in an in-custody
            Therapeutic and Teaching Community. There, he played a crucial role
            in guiding and supporting individuals as they prepared for
            reintegration into society.
          </p>

          <p>
            Jason‚Äôs path to PRPSN was shaped by his own personal journey‚Äîhaving
            spent more than 27 years incarcerated from the age of 16, he
            understands firsthand the challenges of reentry and the critical
            need for peer-driven support systems. Today, he is committed to
            continuous growth and seeking opportunities to make a lasting,
            positive impact in his community. Through his work, he remains a
            beacon of hope, proving that transformation is possible and that
            lived experience is a powerful tool for change.

              State University Northridge, an achievement that reflects her deep
              passion for advocacy and community support. With a strong

              ensure that individuals facing systemic barriers receive the
              resources and guidance necessary for successful reintegration into
              society. Her work at Project 180 allows her to engage with diverse
              populations, providing trauma-informed care, case management, and
              rehabilitation support for those affected by the criminal justice
              system.

              struggling with mental health challenges, substance use disorders,
              and the difficulties of re-entry after incarceration. She believes
              in the power of community-based interventions and holistic support
              services to foster long-term stability and empowerment. Her
              approach emphasizes compassion, resilience, and the importance of
              tailored care to meet the unique needs of each person she serves.

              Beyond her professional life, Sandy is an avid traveler, finding
              inspiration in exploring new cultures and perspectives. She also
              has a passion for cooking, often experimenting with new recipes
              that bring her family together. As a dedicated moviegoer, she
              appreciates the power of storytelling and the ability of films to
              spark important conversations about social issues.
            </p>

            <p>
              Looking ahead, Sandy remains committed to expanding her impact in
              the field of social work, striving to develop innovative programs
              that address the intersection of mental health and criminal
              justice. She hopes to continue advocating for policy changes that
              promote rehabilitation over punishment and ensure that underserved
              communities receive the care and opportunities they deserve.

              <h3>Founder of Pride In Truth</h3>
              Maria C. Gonzalez is a passionate social justice advocate, a
              formerly incarcerated leader, a first-generation immigrant, and a
              dedicated single mother. Born in Jalisco, Mexico, she migrated
              with her family to the Central Valley, where she experienced the
              realities of life in a small farm-working community. Growing up,
              Maria witnessed firsthand the struggles of marginalized
              communities, including labor exploitation, systemic racism, and
              the absence of resources for immigrant families. Her parents
              sought a better life in the United States, and today, Maria
              continues their fight‚Äîadvocating for youth, incarcerated
              individuals, and undocumented people to demand the rights and
              opportunities they deserve.
            </p>

            <p>
              Maria‚Äôs leadership is deeply rooted in lived experience. Having
              endured the oppressive weight of systemic injustice, she
              intimately understands the challenges faced by those directly
              impacted by incarceration. From an early age, Maria faced
              adversity‚Äînavigating poverty, discrimination, and the trauma of
              gun violence. The tragic murder of her best friend, Gilbert Braz,
              in 1996 was a pivotal moment that changed her life forever.
              Overwhelmed by grief, anger, and loss, she struggled with survival
              mode, carrying the pain of his unsolved case for years. Despite
              these hardships, Maria transformed her pain into purpose.
            </p>

            <p>
              After experiencing incarceration herself, she committed to
              breaking cycles of violence and injustice, dedicating her life to
              empowering others. She is the Executive Leader of Pride In Truth,
              an organization that centers the voices and needs of those most
              impacted by unjust systems. Through her leadership, she works to
              dismantle barriers for system-impacted individuals and create
              spaces for healing, advocacy, and policy change. Maria‚Äôs activism
              extends beyond leadership roles‚Äîshe is a hands-on changemaker. She
              has worked extensively in policy advocacy, alternatives to
              incarceration, and diversion programs, ensuring that individuals
              affected by the justice system have access to support and
              resources.
            </p>

            <p>
              Recognizing the urgent need for intervention, she founded The Braz
              Project in January 2023, a community-driven initiative honoring
              Gilbert‚Äôs legacy by providing mentorship, violence prevention, and
              advocacy for at-risk youth. Through resilience and determination,
              Maria has turned her life‚Äôs hardships into a source of strength
              for others. She stands as a testament to the power of redemption,
              proving that those impacted by the system can not only rebuild
              their own lives but also uplift entire communities. Today, she
              continues her fight for justice, equity, and healing, ensuring
              that no one is left behind.

              <h3>TimeDone Manager at Californians for Safety and Justice</h3>
              Gilbert Johnson is a native of South Central Los Angeles who has
              transformed his life from early challenges into a career dedicated
              to social justice and community empowerment. Facing family issues
              and first arrested at 16, he battled substance abuse throughout
              his youth. In 2009, during his last incarceration, Gilbert was
              introduced to community organizing, a pivotal experience that led
              him to sobriety and a new path.
            </p>

            <p>
              Following his release, Gilbert became a lead justice organizer at
              Community Coalition, a prominent social justice organization in
              South Central LA. In this role, he spearheaded multiple civic
              engagement campaigns, contributing to the passage of significant
              criminal justice reform policies in California, including
              Propositions 47, 57, and 17.
            </p>

            <p>
              Gilbert played an integral role in the South LA Community Safety
              Initiative, a community-driven effort aimed at enhancing safety
              through youth development, safe passages, and trauma-informed
              healing circles. He was instrumental in drafting the 10-Point Plan
              to Reduce Crime and Violence in South Central LA, which laid the
              foundation for this initiative.
            </p>

            <p>
              In his current capacity as the Director of Strategic Reentry
              Initiatives in the Office of Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass, Gilbert
              continues his commitment to justice reform. He also serves on the
              Los Angeles County Office of Violence Prevention‚Äôs Community
              Partnership Council and the Los Angeles Reentry Health Advisory
              Collaborative, where he collaborates with other leaders to advise
              on policies and strategies aimed at reducing crime and supporting
              reentry efforts.
            </p>
            <p>
              Beyond policy and advocacy, Gilbert remains deeply engaged with
              individuals returning home from incarceration, ensuring they
              receive the resources, mentorship, and opportunities necessary to
              reintegrate successfully. He understands firsthand the
              difficulties of overcoming societal stigma, securing employment,
              and rebuilding relationships, which fuels his dedication to
              creating sustainable support networks. Through public speaking,
              mentorship programs, and leadership development initiatives, he
              works to empower formerly incarcerated individuals to reclaim
              their narratives and become leaders in their own right.
            </p>
            <p>
              Looking ahead, Gilbert envisions expanding reentry programs that
              address the root causes of incarceration, such as poverty, trauma,
              and lack of access to education. He is a firm believer in
              restorative justice and aims to bridge the gap between impacted
              communities and policy-driven solutions. His life's work is a
              testament to the power of redemption, proving that with the right
              support and opportunities, individuals can transform not only
              their own lives but also the communities around them.

            <h3>Civil Rights Advocate & Community Health Sponsor</h3>
            Sergio Garcia is a dedicated Substance Abuse Counselor from Los
            Angeles, CA, and a product of Norwalk's tough yet nurturing
            environment. Motivated by his own life experiences, he is deeply
            passionate about guiding individuals through their journey of
            recovery, offering not only his professional knowledge but also his
            personal empathy. His mission is rooted in his belief that with the
            right support, anyone can overcome the challenges of addiction and
            turn their lives around. With a foundation built on faith,
            education, and lived experience, Sergio's counseling approach helps
            those struggling with substance abuse see their true potential and
            reclaim their lives.
          </p>

          <p>
            Sergio emphasizes the importance of acknowledging one's struggles as
            a source of strength rather than weakness. Through his own
            challenges, he has learned to transform hardship into resilience and
            helps others do the same, guiding them away from being defined by
            their circumstances or stigmas. With a heart full of hope, he
            aspires to be a motivational speaker, reaching wider audiences and
            empowering individuals facing addiction. His ultimate goal is to
            create a foundation that helps people reach their healthiest
            potential, mentally and physically, by offering resources and
            guidance that promote self-worth and growth.
          </p>

          <p>
            When he‚Äôs not dedicating himself to his work, Sergio enjoys
            spontaneous mini vacations, traveling to new places, and sharing
            these experiences with friends and family. His personal journey
            continues to fuel his professional drive, and he remains steadfast
            in his belief that no one is beyond hope or redemption.
